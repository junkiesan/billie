### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

    Ruby 2.6

### Launching the app

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
env running

For it's first launch and every time a new gem is installed run the following command :

    $ bundle install

Create the db

    $ rails db:create

Then run the migrations

    $ rails db:migrate

_Every time a migration is added, don't forget to run the migration._

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

We're using Rspec and capybara to test the codebase.

In the rspec directory run the following command:

`$ rpsec spec/directory_name/name_of_file_spec.rb`

Example to run the book models tests
`$ rspec spec/models/book_spec.rb`
